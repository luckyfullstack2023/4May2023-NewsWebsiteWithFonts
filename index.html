            <p>Imran Khan's ex-wife Reham Khan did not take any name in her comment after Imran Khan's arrest on Tuesday.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Without naming Imran Khan, his ex-wife Reham Khan said she has no personal vendetta against anyone and her only concern has been the safety of Pakistanis. The comment comes hours after former Pakistan PM Imran Khan was arrested dramatically in a corruption case. "Individuals have been used by external forces to cripple the economy & create anarchy throughout our chequered history. We need to change our course," Reham Khan wrote. "It is not a moment to rejoice but a moment to reflect. Those who celebrated in 2018 are mourning today," Reham wrote while Pakistan sees violent protests by Imran Khan supporters.</p>
        <p>70-year-old Imran Khan spent the night in custody as he was not granted a bail by the court which called the arrest 'legal'. On Wednesday, he was scheduled to be presented before the accountability court. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) said it "will do its best to keep Imran Khan under custody for at least four to five days". “We will seek the maximum physical remand of 14 days from the court," a NAB source was quoted by news agency PTI as saying.</p>
        <p>Imran Khan was detained at NAB's Rawalpindi regional headquarters in a "comfortable atmostphere", reports said. Despite allegations from his party workers that he was wounded in the process of the sudden arrest, NAB said Imran Khan will not be treated harshly and will be only questioned regarding his alleged involvement in the case.</p>
        <p>The case pertains to Al-Qadir Trust which is co-owned by Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi.</p>
        <p>Reham Khan has been a much-discussed name in Pakistan politics as she spilled many secrets about Imran Khan after their 10-month marriage (2005) fell apart. The Pakistani-British television journalist in 2022 announced her marriage to model and actor Mirza Bilal Baig.</p>

        <p>India's star batter Virat Kohli has been in the midst of controversies over the past few weeks in the 2023 Indian Premier League. Last month, the eagled-eyed fans noticed a no-handshake between Kohli and former BCCI President Sourav Ganguly, that created a furore on social media. While the two did meet warmly on RCB's return leg to Delhi Capitals last week, Kohli's ugly spat with Gautam Gambhir after RCB's game against Lucknow Super Giants -- that took place on May 1 -- continues to draw opinions on Twitter.</p>
        <p>Kohli initially had a tussle with LSG's Afghanistan bowler Naveen-ul-Haq during the match; following the game, Naveen and Kohli had a full-blown argument following which the former pushed RCB star's hand. Kohli, then, had a spat with Gambhir, who is the mentor for the Super Giants. And it seems the argument wasn't confined to the field; on Tuesday, Naveen-ul-Haq posted a couple of cryptic Instagram stories that fans deduced to be a dig at Kohli – the Afghanistan bowler posted one of the stories when MI required 8 runs to win in the 17th over.</p>

            <p>When alcohol is consumed, it can have a range of effects on the gut microbiome, depending on the amount consumed and the frequency of consumption,(Pixabay)</p>
        </div>
        <p>Excessive consumption of alcohol has been linked to a range of short-term and chronic health issues from heart disease, stroke, liver disease to cancer. Alcohol over a period of time can weaken immune system, cause memory issues and brain disorders. Alcohol and its metabolite acetaldehyde are both classified as a Group 1 carcinogens or cancer-causing agents. Alcohol consumption is also a risk factor for mouth, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, breast, bowel and liver cancers. One of the many ways alcohol harms your body is by causing gut health issues. It can affect the balance of bacteria in the gut microbiome which could lead to production of more harmful than healthy bacteria which in turn may cause digestive troubles like bloating, gas, leaky gut, loose motions among other issues. (Also read: Alcohol consumption contributes to chronic pain: Study)</p>
        <p>"The gut is home to a vast ecosystem of bacteria and other microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiome. The health of this microbiome is essential to overall well-being, as it plays a critical role in digestion, nutrient absorption, and immune function. When alcohol is consumed, it can have a range of effects on the gut microbiome, depending on the amount consumed and the frequency of consumption," says Dr Amol Dahale, Consultant, Gastroentrology, Manipal Hospital, Baner-Pune.</p>

        <p>After the opening game defeat to PBKS, KKR defeated RCB comfortably at the Eden gardens and then won their second match in a row as they beat GT by three wickets in a thriller at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The batters could not repeat their heroics against SRH as they fell short by 23 runs while chasing a target of 228 in Kolkata in the reverse fixture. KKR then lost to MI at the Wankhede and lost to DC by four wickets in Delhi. KKR made it four losses in a row as they lost by 49 runs to CSK as they were unable to chase a mammoth 236 run target. KKR then got a much-needed win as they beat RCB at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. But then lost their next game to GT. Since then they have turned a corner and defeated SRH and PBKS in their last two games.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Though India's arms imports fell 11% between 2013-17 and 2018-22, the country is still the world’s top importer of military hardware, a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said on Monday.</p>

        <p>India’s arms imports fell 11% between 2013-17 and 2018-22, but the country is still the world’s top importer of military hardware, a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said on Monday. The report comes at a time when India has sharpened its focus on achieving self-reliance in defence manufacturing.</p>   
        <p>India’s share of the global arms imports was the highest in the past five years at 11%, followed by Saudi Arabia (9.6%), Qatar (6.4%), Australia (4.7%) and China (4.7%), according to data published by the think tank that measures weapons imports over five-year periods.</p>
        <p>The latest report is in line with what last year’s Sipri report said. In 2022, it said India’s imports fell 21% between 2012-16 and 2017-21, but that the country was still the world’s biggest arms importer. The new report said the reasons for the decline in India’s imports included attempts to replace imports with local makes and a complex procurement process.</p>

        </div> 
        <p>Maharashtra deputy chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday expressed satisfaction over the Supreme Court's verdict refusing to restore the then Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by Uddhav Thackeray and called it the victory of democracy and the democratic process. Fadnavius asserted that the apex court's judgment held the Shiv Sena-BJP government legal and constitutional even as the five-judge Constitution bench pulled up then Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for calling a trust vote and held the Speaker's decision to appoint Bharat Gogawale of the Shinde faction as the whip of Shiv Sena “illegal”.
        </p>   
        <p>“Today, Maha Vikas Aghadi's (MVA) conspiracy has been defeated. Now, no one should doubt that the Maharashtra government is completely legal,” said Fadnavis.
